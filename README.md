this is my shitty code i wrote for "Grundlagen der Intelligenten Systeme" VU

for this task we were given (incomplete (shitty)) pseudocode and we were supposed to turn it into real code.
but this pseudocode was beyond dog, so i took some code i've found on a website as inspiration and andjusted it for my use case

this is probably the single worst code i've ever written. it is a very unstructured spagehtti mess but i still want 
to upload it in case i (or somebody else) might need it
